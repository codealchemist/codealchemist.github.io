# Me

This is my personal website.

New releases will include random coolness and proof of concept.

This is one tiny web playground.

### ThreeJS + React

The current version explores using ThreeJS with React.

It displays a simple cube which rotates on the X axis.

For any given active face on the cube a small html block is displayed below.

The cube can be rotated by dragging it or by using the arrow keys.

### Scaffolding

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Exploring

If you feel like cloning this repo and playing with it, please, be my guest!

Enjoy!
